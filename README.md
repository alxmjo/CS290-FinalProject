# Rovergram

### About 

Images taken by the Mars rovers Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit remind me of the early days of Hipstamatic and Instagram: moody black and white, square aspect ratio, etc. What if the rovers had their own accounts and were able to share overly-contrasty black and white photos of their Martian exploits? Enter Rovergram.

Because the images on this site are gathered dynamically from NASA, it would make sense to automatically include the most recent images from the rovers on each page load. However, the API [does not currently support](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api/issues/67) this functionality. Instead, I decided to pick sols (Martian days) with interesting photos and collect those via the API.
